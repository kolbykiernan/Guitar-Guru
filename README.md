# Guitar Guru

Guitar Guru is a browser-based interactive experience where users learn basics of music through piano and guitar. The notes were uploaded from my own piano/guitar, and the instruments will respond both both audibly and visually to provide a real-life experience. Being my first project, the goal was to make an interactive experience that works. Naturally I faced many challenges. One of the challenges I faced was looping keys, which you can see by my code I avoided. I have been coding for many months now since working on this project and this would be the first thing I would refactor. The other is that I created this project on a Mac, so the option key is used for some common Windows keyboard shortcuts. After learning notes on the piano and guitar, I would like users to play chords, and eventually songs.
